Machine learning projects using python

I initially got interested in machine learning in college and started to google everything about it since it seemed exciting at first. Then found out it invloved a lot of linear algebra and calculus and I got intrigued more because I was interested in math. Then I came across this famous machine learning introductory course by Andrew NG. I completed it with all the practical assignment and then did these small time python projects to explore what is possible with machine learning.
